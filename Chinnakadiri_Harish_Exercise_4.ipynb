Some kids even refer to Prabhas as a cut-out, and that's exactly what he is for the entirety of the initial half. Though he looks good, the man is stiffer than tree bark, and Eashwari Rao (playing his mother) is supposedly emoting for the both of them, as she's asked to ham it up. I haven't seen Ugramm and I don't intend to see it either, especially if it's anything like this.It's only in the second half that the film starts its world-building exercise, and since there's only 90 minutes to do so, writer-director Prashant Neel is forced to explain key plot points over voiceovers. Dozens of new characters are introduced, a whole lawbook is explained in a few shots and lines, a power tussle is set in motion. It's also here that Prithviraj Sukumaran enters the scene but for a large chunk of the film, neither he nor Prabhas have any essential bits of dialogue. All of it is reserved for the final act and the cliffhanger(ish) finale, and though the duo redeemed their parts to some extent, I barely felt the emotional strength of their presumed, long-standing friendship. Ravi Basrur delivers a humdrum score, and except for the main theme, his efforts fell short. The less said about the edits, the better.It also sucks that the set pieces feel boringly repetitive (goons are flying in all directions) and the only instance I felt like appreciating cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda's work is during an action block set in a village where Goddess Kali is the deity. There are some fantastic shot choices in this segment, supplemented well by the color grading. The rest of the film visually feels like an extension of the KGF franchise, there isn't much here that you haven't seen in those two films. Also, I'm glad I saw this in Tamil; the dubbing was decent, and the translations too weren't the shabbiest. Still, Salaar Part 1 did next to nothing for me as a cinephile - utterly disposable!\",\n          \"To be honest. It is very long and boring. We have already seen KGF and the same pattern follows. Nothing new, nothing entertaining. Prashanth is still in the KGF world. Visuals, back ground score is okay but as I said i still felt like KGF.The story is very confusing because of too many characters , it could have been crisp and shorter. It's not at all engaging, too many serious characters which I don't mind instead it could have been entertaining. Too much hype and we think like something is going to happen but man it is seriously silly and nothing really doesn't happen.Take it easy Prashanth Neel.One word.. BORING.!\",\n          \"After the big success of KGF, I had high hopes for this movie. I went to the morning show and was surprised at how long and boring it turned out to be. First, bring a torch because the movie is quite dark. Second, you don't need to bring your brain as every action scene is nonsensical. The lead actor beats others who then fly and bounce on the floor after getting hit. The first half has a lot of buildup about Deva, creating frustration before Prabhas's entry. The second half is incredibly boring with too many forgettable characters, making it hard to sit through in the theater. Overall, it's a three-hour-long, boring, slow-paced film with bad and funny Hindi dubbing. Avoid it.

        "#Matrix decomposition is utilized in LSA to grab the topics or subjects, and dimension reduction helps to explain them according to how they load onto words. While most of the time, negative values of its loadings might occasionally make interpretation more difficult. LSA maintains the two primary inputs of the corpus and the dictionary. LDA, on the other hand, links terms within the text and terms from other possible sources. Its ability to handle complex language is one of the top qualities. It is interesting to note that the product reviews at the top and bottom of the list are fairly similar. The power of LDA is that it is capable of discovering real topics from the original matrix document while leaving alone other information. Hence, LDA will usually outperform coupled efforts of BERT and LDA, outperforming one another."

        "Please write you answer here:My journey of working with text data and exploring different topic modeling algorithms, including LDA, NMF, LSA, and HDP, has been very enlightening.\n",
        "I familiarized myself with the theoretical framework behind each of those algorithms and learned how to apply them to distill meaningful clusters of topics from large text datasets.\n",
        "The different background of these algorithms, including LDA’s probabilistic basis, NMF and its non-negative matrix factorization, LSA and its use of dimensionality reduction, and HDP’s flexibility, provided me with a comprehensive understanding of how these work.\n",
        "Furthermore, getting the ability to implement these models on data has allowed me to see the subtleties of how feature extraction works in practice and how different approaches often reveal different aspects of the data.\n",
        "This allowed me to better use my natural language processing skills and also to see how important preprocessing is and how much the choice of an algorithm affects the interpretability and coherence of topics.\n",
        "In summary, I feel that this combination of theory and practice significantly improved my toolkit for working with unstructured text data.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, it is not easy to understand which settings are best to use in the model, especially with the LDA method.\n",
        "These settings are called hyperparamters and they help in deciding how the model sees topics in the documents.\n",
        "Getting the right settings can be hard and can take a lot of time and computer power because changing these settings can really change what topics the model will find.\n",
        "The difficulty with topics is to understand if the ones your model finds are good ones or not. Indeed, there is no easy way to measure it; it often takes someone who knows a lot about the subject to look at the topics and say if they make sense or not.\n",
        "This add also another difficulty: it can be hard to compare models and methods with one another, since what looks like a good topic to one person might not to another.\n",
        "\n",
        "It’s been great to learn about topic modeling- such as LDA and NMF- as part of my journey into data science.\n",
        "I’ve learned how to identify important themes in huge amounts of text: a critical skill when trying to understand large data sets.\n",
        "But it’s not just learning about text; I’ve added another fantastic set of tools to my data science skills, making me even better at understanding what sets of data mean.\n",
        "I have also been able to improve my problem-solving abilities both by learning how to assess whether I’ve made the correct selections and by assessing my results in terms of what makes them effective or inefficient.\n",
